# Lab 9 guide

## First half: Data cleaning

This part will be done all together, with the TAs mainly asking leading questions rather than lecturing. Students should be driving, telling the TA what to do. The TA will be live-coding; students can do the same if they like. At a high level, the class will:

1. Create a notebook.
1. Download the dataset. (TBD)
1. Clean the data.

## Second half: Joining

Introduce [Lab 9](lab_9.ipynb).
