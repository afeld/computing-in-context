# [Lab 8](lab_8.ipynb) guide

**Goal:** Have students understand how to share their work on the web

For [the GitHub section](lab_8.ipynb#github), we are just looking to get their code in a public repo.

- We're trying to get them ready for [publishing to Read the Docs in Project 3](project_3.md#publish).
- Resist the urge to show them more complex topics like:
  - Issues
  - Branches
  - Pull requests
