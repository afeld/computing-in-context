# [Lab 8](lab_8.ipynb) guide

**Goal:** Have students share their work on the web

- It's a long lab; it's ok if you don't get through all of it. Students can finish on their own.
- For [the GitHub section](lab_8.ipynb#github), we are just looking to get their code in a public repo.
- Resist the urge to show them more complex topics like:
  - Issues
  - Branches
  - Pull requests
