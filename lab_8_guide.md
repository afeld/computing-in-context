# Lab 8 guide

**Goal:** Ensure students are set up for the rest of the course and comfortable using Jupyter.

## Setup

1. For those who have the Anaconda Distribution (called "Anaconda" for short) installed, [update it](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/tools/anaconda-navigator/update-navigator). Everyone else, [install it](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/anaconda/install).
   - Can skip registration
1. [Add the `conda-forge` channel.](notebooks.md#installing-packages)
1. Ensure `pandas` and `plotly` are [installed](notebooks.md#installing-packages).
1. Launch JupyterLab.

## Try it!

Run [this example](https://plotly.com/python/linear-fits/#Linear-fit-trendlines-with-Plotly-Express) in your local Jupyter.

_FYI `px.data.tips()` loads one of [Plotly's sample datasets](https://plotly.com/python-api-reference/generated/plotly.express.data.html). You don't need that when plotting other datasets._

## Walkthrough

1. Walk through [working with notebooks from course site](notebooks.md#downloading-notebooks).
1. Reiterate [Jupyter basics](lecture_15.ipynb#jupyter-basics).
1. Try some Markdown.
1. Talk through [Lab 8](lab_8.ipynb).
