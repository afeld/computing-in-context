# Lab 8 guide

**Goal:** Ensure students are set up for the rest of the course and comfortable using Jupyter.

## Setup

1. Create a folder for this lab (like `lab_8/`). Can do this from Finder/Explorer, or terminal:

   ```sh
   mkdir lab_8
   ```

1. In the terminal, navigate to the directory. For example:

   ```sh
   cd ~/Documents/SIPA/Computing\ in\ Context/lab_8
   ```

1. [Set up the virtual environment.](notebooks.md#installing-packages)
1. Install the `pandas` and `plotly` packages.
1. Launch JupyterLab.

## Try it!

Run [this example](https://plotly.com/python/linear-fits/#Linear-fit-trendlines-with-Plotly-Express) in your local Jupyter.

_FYI `px.data.tips()` loads one of [Plotly's sample datasets](https://plotly.com/python-api-reference/generated/plotly.express.data.html). You don't need that when plotting other datasets._

## Walkthrough

1. Walk through [working with notebooks from course site](notebooks.md#downloading-notebooks).
1. Reiterate [Jupyter basics](lecture_15.ipynb#jupyter-basics).
1. Try some Markdown.
1. Talk through [Lab 8](lab_8.ipynb).
