# Project 2

In this project, you will:

- Work across datasets
- Create data visualization(s)

## Objective

In this Project, you will **take two datasets and show a relationship (or lack thereof) in one visualization** (chart or map). This can mean:

- Plotting information from both as separate lines/points
- Merging the datasets and plotting a derived measure
- etc.

Here is [a thorough example](https://python-public-policy.afeld.me/en/columbia/final_project/universities.html) - yours does _not_ need to be that complex though.

## Requirements

- Use Python/pandas for everything
  - You can use a spreadsheet program for simple preparation like extracting a table from a larger sheet (explain in the notebook if you do this), but all data cleaning, merging, visualizations, etc. should be done in code.
- Data from two datasets is reflected in a single visualization
  - There can be additional visualizations
- State the takeaway(s)
- [General Project information](projects.md)

## Tips

- The relationship you're showing doesn’t need to be something novel; replicating something you saw / read / heard about is fine.
