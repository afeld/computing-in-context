# [Lab 12](lab_12.ipynb) guide

## Goals

Students should get practice with:

- Time series data
  - Resampling
- Scraping
- APIs
  - How to read their documentation
  - How to use them from Python

## Steps

1. **~20 minutes:** Buses
   - If you have time, make a chart. Otherwise, showing in a table is fine.
1. Introduce scraping
   - Don't need to spend long on this
1. Work together in notebook through [Querying](lab_12.ipynb#querying).
   - Have students drive
   - You can get them started on [Pagination](lab_12.ipynb#pagination) if they are feeling shaky.
