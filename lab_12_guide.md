# [Lab 12](lab_12.ipynb) guide

**Goal:** Get familiar with how to read documentation for, test, and use APIs.

## First half

1. Introduce scraping
   - Don't need to spend long on this
1. Work together in notebook through [Querying](lab_12.ipynb#querying).
   - Have students drive
   - For [the GitHub section](lab_12.ipynb#github), we are just looking to get their code in a public repo.
     - We're trying to get them ready for [publishing to Read the Docs in Project 3](project_3.md#jupyterbook).
     - Resist the urge to show them more complex topics like:
       - Issues
       - Branches
       - Pull requests
   - You can get them started on [Pagination](lab_12.ipynb#pagination) if they are feeling shaky.

## Second half

Independent work time for the rest
