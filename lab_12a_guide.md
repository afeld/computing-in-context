# Lab 11 guide

**Goal:** Students should get practice with:

- Grouping
- Mapping
- Resampling
- Multi-line charts

Do the following in [the lab notebook](lab_11.ipynb) all together, with students driving.

1. **~35 minutes:** Buses
   - You'll need to introduce [`pd.to_datetime()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#converting-to-timestamps) and [`resample()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/intro_tutorials/09_timeseries.html#resample-a-time-series-to-another-frequency), since we didn't get to them yet.
     - You can keep this fairly brief, as we'll revisit in [Lecture 22](lecture_22.ipynb).
     - See [the slides from Python for Public Policy](https://python-public-policy.afeld.me/en/columbia/lecture_4.html#convert-columns-to-timestamps-using-pandas-to-datetime) for ideas on how to talk about them.
   - If you have time, make charts. Otherwise, showing in a table is fine.
1. 311 and COVID
   1. **~30 minutes:** Work through Step 5 together.
      - You'll need to introduce [resampling with other grouping](https://python-public-policy.afeld.me/en/columbia/lecture_4.html#resampling-with-other-grouping) for Step 3 since we didn't get to it yet.
   1. **~25 minutes:** Independent work time for the rest.

While the [solutions for the first two sections](lab_11_solutions.ipynb) are available,

- Discourage students from looking at them before completing
- The solutions the group comes up with don't need to look like the provided ones
