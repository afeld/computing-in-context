# Testimonials

```{epigraph}
I just wanted to [thank] you for an insightful and intriguing semester. I appreciated the opportunity to hear from you and learn more about open source data and how to use code to test different hypotheses. This was definitely a class that I was challenged in, felt times of frustration, and really pushed me mentally and academically. However, I was grateful that you were open to my questions and helped validate our journeys into computer science. In the end, I am happy to say that I completed the class and that I am able to add a new level of grandeur to my research.
